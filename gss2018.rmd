# Introduction Question 1

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->

This data is from the 2018 General Social Survey. The first blocks of R-code has selected down a subset of the data to just 15 variables. It has further removed unwanted factor levels in much of the data. Examine that code to see what it is doing. Finally address this question.  Is opinion on the death penalty (CAPPUN) independent of gun ownership (OWNGUN)?


## Methods

<!--Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method.!-->

##Results

<!--Divide this section into two sub-sections:  One for your descriptive  results and one for your inferential results.!-->

### Descriptive Results

#### Graphical Descriptive Results

<!--Graphical results here.  Make sure to show your code.  Provide appropriate labels for axes, giving units if possible, and provide a good title for the graph, too.  Use the graphical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->
```{r}
barchartGC(~CAPPUN + OWNGUN,data=mydata4)
barchartGC(~CAPPUN + OWNGUN,data=mydata4,type="percent")
```


#### Numerical Descriptive Results

<!--Numerical results go here. Use the numerical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->
```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~CAPPUN + OWNGUN, data=mydata4)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```

### Inferential Results
```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
chisqtestGC(table1)
```

<!--State hypothesis clearly.  Make sure your discussion of the inferential test covers all the aspects that the test output produces, such as test statistic, p-value etc.  Make a decision about the null hypothesis, explain the assumptions on which the selected test/procedure was based, and why the chosen procedure satisfys the assumptions and is appropriate to answer the research question!-->

# Introduction Question 2

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->

Now answer Is belief in the bigbang theory (BIGBANG) independent of belief in the afterlife (POSTLIFE)

# Introduction Question 3

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->

Finally determine if a persons opinion on death penalty (CAPPUN) is independent of their race (RACE).

# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If you found a relationship be sure to consider whether the relationship occurs because one of the variavbles causes the other, or whether they perhasps are related for some other reason.  Watch the chapter 6 videos from the GeorgeTown videos collection.!-->
